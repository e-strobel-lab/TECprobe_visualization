# Stored riboswitch #
Used to determine whether to use stored or user inputted transcript ranges for data subsetting. The riboswitches with stored subsets are: Clostridium beijerinckii ZTP (20-130 and 159-162), Bacillus cereus fluoride (20-82 and 113-116), and Clostridiales bacterium oral taxon 876 str. F0540 ppGpp (20-137 and 169-172). The transcript lengths selected are used to determine the reactivities used for the correlation plot and to calculate the Pearson's Correlation Coefficient. If the user is analyzing one of the listed riboswitches and would like to use the pre-determined transcript lengths, set value to True. Otherwise, set to False.
Default=True

>ribo_stored=


# Number of transcript length ranges #
Used to set the number of transcript ranges to keep for data plotting and Pearson Correlation Coefficient calculation. Input should be a single integer (e.g. If the user would like to keep transcript lengths 20-80 and 100-130, the user's input would be 2).
There is no default value set, and if ribo_stored is set to False, this must have a value.

>num_range=


# Transcript lengths for plotting/calculation #
Used to set the transcript lengths whose nucleotide reactivites are plotted and used to calculate the Pearson Correlation Coefficient. Inputs should be integers separated by a comma. The number of inputs should be double the value of num_range. Inputs should be presented as min1,max1,min2,max2, etc. The smallest acceptable transcript length is 20, as the first 19 transcript lengths are not processed.
There is no default value set, and if ribo_stored is set to False, this must have a value.

>txpt_keep=


# Filename #
Set the name used to save data matrices and heatmaps with. Automatically attached to this is the RNA name, probing method, chemical probe used, concentration and name of the ligand, and the hexbin gridsize. The filename can only contain alphanumeric characters along with hyphen (-) or underscore (_) characters. All spaces will be replaced with underscores.
Default=Generated by the script containing the RNA name, probing method, chemical probe used, concentration and name of the ligand, and the hexbin gridsize.

### Graph parameters ###
########################

# Reactivity heatmap palette #
Sets the color palette for the bexbin plot. Must be compatible with the seaborn color_palette method. For more information on acceptible palettes, visit https://matplotlib.org/stable/tutorials/colors/colormaps.html.
Default=viridis

> palette=


# Gridsize #
Sets the number of hexagons in x- and y-directions.
Default=100

>gridsize=


# Vmax #
Sets the Vmax for the hexbin plot.
Default=500

>vmax=


# Graph title #
Sets the title for the hexbin plot generated.
Default=Uses the stored filename appended to the RNA name, probing method, chemical probe used, concentration and name of the ligand, and the hexbin gridsize.

> title=


# Axes windows #
Set the min/max values for the x- and y-axes, which represent reactivities of replicate 1 and 2, respectively. If this parameter is set, the user must pass two integers separated by a comma (e.g. 0,2).
Default=Calculated min/max values from the data being plotted.

> x-axis=
> y-axis=


# Font sizes #
Set the font size of the x- and y-axes tick labels, x- and y-axes labels, and the graph title. The inputs must be an integer or float.

Default=10
>x_tick_size=
>y_tick_size=

Default=10
>x_label_size=
>y_label_size=

Default=15
>title_size=


# Figure size #
Set the size of the figure with the dimensions set in inches. If this parameter is set, the user must pass two floats or integers separated by a comma (e.g. 5,5). Inputs are processed as width, length.
Default=10,10

> fig_size=


# Filetype #
Set the format to save the graphs as. Acceptable filetypes: ps, eps, pdf, pgf, png, raw, rgba, svg, jpg, jpeg, tif, tiff. 
Default=png

> filetype=


# DPI #
Set the dpi for the graphs. 
Default=figure (This determines the value based on the set filetype)
