# Reactivity column to plot #
Sets the column of reactivity data to assemble into a heatmap matrix. The options are:
Reactivity_profile - Background-subtracted mutation rate.
Norm_calc_profile - Data that were normalized with a single normalization factor for the whole dataset.
Norm_profile - Data that were normalized with separate normalization factors for each transcript length.
Indiv_Norm_profile - Data that were normalized with separate normalization factors for each transcript length.

NOTE: Norm_profile and Indiv_Norm_profile represent the same data, but the name of the column is dependent upon whether normalization was calculated when using the 'compile_sm2_output' script. If normalization was set to FALSE, 'Norm_profile' is available. If normalization was set to TRUE, 'Indiv_Norm_profile' is available.

NOTE: 'Norm_calc_profile' is ONLY available if normalization was set to TRUE when running the 'compile_sm2_output' script.

Default=Reactivity_profile

# Filename #
Set the name used to save data matrices and heatmaps with. Automatically attached to this is the RNA name, probing method, chemical probe used, and concentration and name of the ligand. The filename can only contain alphanumeric characters along with hyphen (-) or underscore (_) characters. All spaces will be replaced with underscores.
Default=Generated by the script containing the RNA name, probing method, chemical probe used, and concentration and name of the ligand.

### Graph parameters ###
########################

# Reactivity heatmap palette #
Sets the color palette for the reactivity heatmap. Must be compatible with the seaborn color_palette method. For more information on acceptible palettes, visit https://matplotlib.org/stable/tutorials/colors/colormaps.html.
Default=viridis

> palette_react=


# Effective read depth heatmap palette #
Sets the color palette for the effective read depth heatmaps. Must be compatible with the seaborn color_palette method. For more information on acceptible palettes, visit https://matplotlib.org/stable/tutorials/colors/colormaps.html.
Default=magma

> palette_read=


# Reactivity heatmap Vmax #
Sets the Vmax for the reactivity heatmap.
For normalized reactivities, Default=2.
For background-subtracted mutation rates, Default= the reactivity at the 95th percentile.

> vmax_react=


# Effective read depth Vmax #
Sets the Vmax for the effective read depth heatmaps. 
Default=The log of the highest read count between both untreated and modified read depth columns.

> vmax_read=


# Graph title #
Sets the title for all heatmaps generated for all datasets provided. An indicator will be placed at the end of the title to indicate the identity of the data ('reactivity' for the reactivity heatmap, 'mod_effective_read_depth for the modified effective read depth heatmap, and 'untreated_effective_read_depth' for the untreated effective read depth heatmap.
Default=Generated by the script containing the RNA name, probing method, chemical probe used, and concentration and name of the ligand.

> title=


# Axes windows #
Set the min/max values for the x- and y-axes, which represent nucleotide position and transcript length, respectively. If this parameter is set, the user must pass two integers separated by a comma (e.g. 20,100). Xmax must be less than or equal to Ymax. Ymin must be greater than or equal to Xmin.
Default=All nucleotide positions and transcript lengths are plotted.

> x-axis=
> y-axis=


# Font sizes #
Set the font size of the x- and y-axes tick labels, x- and y-axes labels, the graph title, and the colorbar label. The inputs must be an integer or float.

Default=10
>x_tick_size=
>y_tick_size=

Default=15
>x_label_size=
>y_label_size=

Default=20
>title_size=

Default = 15
>colorbar_fontsize=


# Figure size #
Set the size of the figure with the dimensions set in inches. If this parameter is set, the user must pass two floats or integers separated by a comma (e.g. 5,5). Inputs are processed as width, length.
Default=10,10

> fig_size=


# Filetype #
Set the format to save the graphs as. Acceptable filetypes: ps, eps, pdf, pgf, png, raw, rgba, svg, jpg, jpeg, tif, tiff. 
Default=png

> filetype=


# DPI #
Set the dpi for the graphs. 
Default=figure (This determines the value based on the set filetype)
