# Stored riboswitch #
Used to determine whether to use stored or user inputted transcript ranges for data subsetting. The riboswitches with stored subsets are: Clostridium beijerinckii ZTP (20-130 and 159-162), Bacillus cereus fluoride (20-82 and 113-116), and Clostridiales bacterium oral taxon 876 str. F0540 ppGpp (20-137 and 169-172). The Pearson's Correlation Coefficient (r) is calculated only for the subsetted transcript lengths and then all r values for each data set is plotted into a violin plot. If the user is analyzing one of the listed riboswitches and would like to use the pre-determined transcript lengths, set value to True. Otherwise, set to False.
Default=True

>ribo_stored=True


# Number of transcript length ranges #
Used to set the number of transcript ranges to keep for Pearson Correlation Coefficient calculation. Input should be a single integer (e.g. If the user would like to keep transcript lengths 20-80 and 100-130, the user's input would be 2).
There is no default value set, and if ribo_stored is set to False, this must have a value.

>num_range=


# Transcript lengths for plotting/calculation #
Used to set the transcript lengths that are used to calculate the Pearson Correlation Coefficient. Inputs should be integers separated by a comma. The number of inputs should be double the value of num_range. Inputs should be presented as min1,max1,min2,max2, etc. The smallest acceptable transcript length is 20, as the first 19 transcript lengths are not processed.
There is no default value set, and if ribo_stored is set to False, this must have a value.

>txpt_keep=


# Filename #
Set the name used to save data matrices and heatmaps with. Automatically attached to this is the RNA name, probing method, chemical probe used, and concentration and name of the ligand. The filename can only contain alphanumeric characters along with hyphen (-) or underscore (_) characters. All spaces will be replaced with underscores.
Default=Generated by the script containing the RNA name, probing method, chemical probe used, and concentration and name of the ligand.

### Graph parameters ###
########################

# Graph title #
Sets the title for the violin plot generated. Automatically attached to this is the RNA name, probing method, chemical probe used, and concentration and name of the ligand.
Default=Generated by the script containing the RNA name, probing method, chemical probe used, and concentration and name of the ligand.

> title=


# Y-axis #
Sets the min/max value for the y-axis. If this parameter is set, the user must pass two integers separated by a comma (e.g. 0,2).
Default=0,1
 
>ylim=


# Title font size #
Set the font size of the title. Input must be of int type.
Default=10

> title_size=


# Figure size #
Set the size of the figure with the dimensions set in inches. If this parameter is set, the user must pass two floats or integers separated by a comma (e.g. 5,5). Inputs are processed as width, length.
Default=10,10

> fig_size=


# Filetype #
Set the format to save the graphs as. Acceptable filetypes: ps, eps, pdf, pgf, png, raw, rgba, svg, jpg, jpeg, tif, tiff. 
Default=png

> filetype=


# DPI #
Set the dpi for the graphs. 
Default=figure (This determines the value based on the set filetype)
